As a Content Studio Manager, I specialize in the dynamic world of lifestyle and studio retouching, 
bringing images to life with meticulous attention to detail. 
My expertise extends to creating realistic 3D product renders that bridge the gap between digital art and reality. 
I am skilled in 2D motion graphics, adding movement and life to static images. 
My proficiency in sizzle reel production allows me to craft compelling, 
narrative-driven short videos that capture the essence of a brand or product.

I am adept at asset localization, ensuring that content resonates with diverse global audiences while maintaining brand consistency. 
My role involves leading creative and product reviews, where I fine-tune each element to align with strategic vision and quality standards. 
Finally, my responsibility culminates in the global delivery of assets, managing the distribution of content across various platforms and regions, 
ensuring a seamless and impactful reach to audiences worldwide.
