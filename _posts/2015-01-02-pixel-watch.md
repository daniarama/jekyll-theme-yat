In this project, I collaborated with Google's Industrial Design/Color Material Finish teams to verify approved static assets. Adjustments were made according to Global Marketing team guidance. We integrated UI into static images and created a short video, highlighting diverse colorways, watchband styles, and UI features for different regions, tailored to our client's needs. <a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_pixel_watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch</a>
