For all lifestyle product shoots, I collaborated tightly with our Art Directors on schedules, budgets, and logistics. I created timelines, managed initial photo selections, and assisted retouchers in color grading to finalize selects. Concurrently, I processed numerous assets across 4-5 product streams for Industrial Design and Creative team review and approval. Afterward, I uploaded all assets to Google's global library and adapted them for use on social media, retail, and the Gstore for worldwide distribution.
