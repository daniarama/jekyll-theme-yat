Recruited for an on-site studio shoot, I worked closely with managers, photographers, and art directors to ensure perfect shots and smooth asset transitions from set to post-production. Faced with a last-minute talent shortage, I stepped in as a hand model. As post-production manager, I oversaw retouching, coordinated with Industrial Design and Creative teams, and handled regional asset adaptation and delivery. <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7a?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Pixel 7A</a>
